# [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

GraphQL is an **open source query language** created by Facebook.
On the backend, GraphQL specifies to the API how to present the data to the client. GraphQL redefines developersâ€™ work with APIs offering more flexibility and speed to market; it improves client-server interactions by enabling the former to make precise data requests and obtain no more and no less, but exactly what they need.

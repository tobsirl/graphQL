# [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

GraphQL is an **open source query language** created by Facebook.
On the backend, GraphQL specifies to the API how to present the data to the client. GraphQL redefines developersâ€™ work with APIs offering more flexibility and speed to market; it improves client-server interactions by enabling the former to make precise data requests and obtain no more and no less, but exactly what they need.

## GraphQL Fundamentals

### GraphQL Operation: Query

### Fields

GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects.
`Field` name returns a `Type` of `String`

```json
# request
{
  viewer {
    name
    url
  }
}

# response
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "name": "Paul Tobin",
      "url": "https://github.com/tobsirl"
    }
  }
}
```



### Arguments

Passing arguments allows us to specify the data we require.
Every field and nested object can get its own set of arguements, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches.

```json
# request
{
  human(id: "1000") {  
    name
    height
  }
}

# response
{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "height": 1.72
    }
  }
}
```
